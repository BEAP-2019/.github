<p align="center"><b>HISTORY</b></p>
The name 'BEAP' was originally recommended by [@ShreyashTailor] (https://github.com/ShreyashTailor).
Though, there was no full form of BEAP.
However in early 2023, under the suggestion of a BEAP member, [@randomboi404] (https://github.com/randomboi404) created BEAP full form of 'Base of Eternal Application for Programming'.
It may sound humourous, but that's it.

<p align="center"><b>WHY 3.0?</b></p>

BEAP had 2 major versions. Original version had nothing special that's why we created V2.0. However, for private reasons, due to internal disputes, it couldn't be developed and that's why here we are, V3.0, the reboot of BEAP!
